### Life contribution
*From Notion database to python heatmap: the journey of my life's contribution diagram*

In the spirit of github coding contribution diagram, I decided to record my every day work out and activity for a whole year. 
This way I am now able to have an colorful overview of my productivity and sedentarity. 
It comes from a Notion database, as it is easy to acces from my pocket and then I can take advantage of the complete desktop version. 


After recording everything, I imported my life to python to develop custom matplotlib matrixes and color maps. 
Finally shaping the matrix to a week by week heatmap as the github contribution diagram. 
Playing with numbers and colors, knowing that each square is meaningfull.
